## @zecos UI libraries

I've gone ahead and created a few input UI libraries, but I hope people won't constrict themselves to using those, because the real power of [`@zecos/input`](/input/overview) is being able to rapidly create your own input UI libraries and reduce your boilerplate. But they are a great place to start, and maybe you can fork them and make them your own.

Here are the libraries I've created:

* [`@zecos/input-basic`](/input/input-basic)
  * Created from scratch
  * Easiest to fork
* [`@zecos/input-mui`](/input/input-mui)
  * Based on [Material UI](https://material-ui.com)
  * Probably the most production-ready

But I would like to create/would accept a PR for [ant](https://ant.design) as well. Only so many hours in the day, you know?
