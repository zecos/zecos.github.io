# Overview

`@zecos/input` and its derivatives are libraries that aim to improve the developer experience (DX) by allowing you to

* reduce boilerplate
* maintain flexibility
* maintain scalability

You can get started with nearly zero-setup and should be able to create an input with one line. Here is a simple text field input:

```tsx
example:0000_overview
```

That is an overly simplified example without any data validation, but you see how simple creating an input can be.

But this along with other features of the `@zecos/input` family can be composed to build powerful UI tools.

It is also easy to export your UI library for others to use or utilize someone else's. I have created two so far:

* [@zecos/input-basic](/input-basic)
* [@zecos/input-mui](/input-mui).
